**Sumarry**
Write is a simple application that builds on top of the nxtDisplayString funciton. 
With Write, you can switch between two modes, Debug mode and Static Mode. Do this 
by pressing the big orange button. The two functions are WriteLine(int screenposition, string towrite),
and WriteDebug(string towrite). When you are in Static mode, it will display all
of the strings written at the position you set, like the normal usage of the nxtDisplayString.
When you are in debug mode, it will display a list of all the strings you have passed to 
WriteDebug, which can be scrolled through using the arrow keys. Remember to InitializeWrite at
the beginning of your code.

**Methods**
InitializeWrite(): Starts the code.
WriteLine(int LineToWrite, string TextToWrite): Adds text to the static page at the specified line.
WriteDebug(string TextToWrite): Adds text to the end of the debug mode page.
WriteDebugInt(int NumberToWrite): Adds a number to the end of the debug mode page.
